# Things to Try on webOS
webOS is *not* a dead platform! There's still plenty of things you can on your webOS device. Here's a couple suggestions to get you started. All of the Apps listed below can be found on [App Museum II](appstores.md), but there's direct download links as well.

## YouTube
YouTube doesn't officially support webOS (or most retro platforms) but thanks to the open source community, its still available. An app called MeTube, available in App Museum II, works with a pair of back-end services to fetch YouTube videos for you on demand. The services are hosted by webOS Archive, but you can also run them yourself, if you prefer.

* [Download the App](http://appcatalog.webosarchive.com/showMuseumDetails.php?search=metube&app=1005774)
* [Self-host the services](https://github.com/codepoet80/metube-php-servicewrapper)

## Podcasts
webOS devices make great Podcast listening tools -- whether its a Touchpad setting in Touchstone, maybe connected to a nice Bluetooth speaker, or a tiny little Pre or Veer, slipped in your pocket as you go about your routine. Many Podcasts have switched to HTTPS, which causes problems for older, encryption-challenged devices, but a Retro Podcast service, hosted by webOS Archive (or you, if you want) solves this, and many other problems. Combined with a stand-alone Podcast Directory app, and a number of Podcast players available in the Museum, you can download and listen to thousands of popular podcasts right on your device.

* Download the [Podcast Directory](http://appcatalog.webosarchive.com/showMuseumDetails.php?search=podcast&app=1005778) app

## The Ultimate Night Stand App
Philips Hue lights are some of the best smart bulbs out there -- whether you use their standard bulbs, color changing bulbs, or their Wake-Up light with sunrise simulation. A little Palm Pre or Veer, or even a Touchpad make great companions, allowing you to control them in a dark room... without needing to put a smart speaker in your room listening to you sleep!

One Night Stand is a night table clock that switches to a light controller with just a tap.

## Be an Exhibitionist
webOS 2.0 and above have a mode called Exhibition, that allows your device to continuously show content while on its charging dock. A photo slide show is an obvious choice -- load up your device with your favorite pictures of family, pets, or scenery, and let the exhibit roll by.

If you'd rather get some information, Accuweather still works on all devices, and on the Touchpad includes a gorgeous Exhibition mode that shows the weather where you are, or in other locations of your choosing.

## Make Something New
webOS is an easy platform to learn to develop on. Based on Javascript, and powered by Linux, is an easy environment to explore, reverse engineer and build upon. If you can make a web page, you can make an App for webOS! Check out the [SDK section](sdkpdk.md) for more info about getting started!
